## Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains a content-based movie recommendation system, which suggests movies to users based on the attributes of the movies and the user's preferences. The recommendation system calculates similarity, typically using cosine similarity, between the user's preferences and movie attributes such as lead actors, directors, and genres.

### How It Works
The recommendation system works by analyzing the attributes of the movies and comparing them with the user's preferences. For example, if a user enjoys a movie like "The Prestige," the system recommends movies with Christian Bale, movies in the thriller genre, or films by Christopher Nolan.

### Features
- Content-based filtering: The recommendation system uses the attributes of the movies to suggest similar movies to the user, based on their preferences.
- Cosine similarity: The system calculates similarity using cosine similarity to determine the closeness of the user's preferences to the attributes of the movies.

### Usage
To use the recommendation system, simply input your preferences, such as favorite actors, genres, or directors, and the system will generate personalized movie recommendations based on your input.

### Limitations
While content-based filtering has its advantages, such as not needing data about other users and being able to recommend niche items, it also has limitations, such as the potential lack of discovery of new genres and movies, and the cold-start problem when there is not enough data about the user's preferences.
